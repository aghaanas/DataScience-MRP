ABSTRACT

In financial statement audits, detecting fraud in accounting data has long been a difficulty. The bulk of currently used approaches are based on handmade rules taken from well-known fraud cases. While effective, these rules have the problem of failing to generalise beyond recognised fraud scenarios, allowing fraudsters to progressively learn ways to get around them. More sophisticated techniques, on the other hand, typically lack smooth interpretability of the discovered findings, as a result of deep learning's recent success. 
The main objective of the current research work is to develop a framework for building anomaly detection algorithm. The research proposes the use of adversarial autoencoder networks to address this problem, such that artificial neural networks can learn to represent real-world diary entries in a semantically meaningful way. The learnt representation gives a comprehensive perspective of a group of journal entries and boosts performance dramatically. 
This research also demonstrates how such a representation, along with the network's rebuilding flaw, may be used to perform an unsupervised, highly adaptable anomaly evaluation.
